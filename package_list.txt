NKI-CCB	TANDEM	A two-stage regression method that can be used when various input data types are correlated, for example gene expression and methylation in drug response prediction. In the first stage it uses the upstream features (such as methylation) to predict the response variable (such as drug response), and in the second stage it uses the downstream features (such as gene expression) to predict the residuals of the first stage. In our manuscript (Aben et al., 2016), we show that using TANDEM prevents the model from being dominated by gene expression and that the features selected by TANDEM are more interpretable.

lbenitesanchez	bssn	It provides the density, distribution function, quantile function, random number generator, reliability function, failure rate, likelihood function, moments and EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimators, also empirical quantile and generated envelope for a given sample, all this for the three parameter Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal Distribution. Additionally, it provides the random number generator for the mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal distribution.

This family of distribution includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's t, Laplace, Slash and Contaminated Normal distribution. It also performs logistic quantile regression for bounded responses as shown in Bottai et.al.(2009) <doi:10.1002/sim.3781>. It provides estimates and full inference. It also provides envelopes plots for assessing the fit and confidences bands when several quantiles are provided simultaneously.
